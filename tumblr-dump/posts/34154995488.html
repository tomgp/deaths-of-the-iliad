<blockquote><p>Patroclus rising beside him stabbed his right jawbone, ramming the spearhead square between his teeth so hard he hooked him by the spearhead over the chariot-rail, hoisted, dragged the Trojan out as an angler perched on a jutting rock ledge drags some fish from the sea, some noble catch, with the line and glittering bronze hook. So with the spear Patroclus gaffed him off his car, his mouth gaping round the glittering point and flipped him down facefirst, dead as he fell, his life breath blown away.</p></blockquote>
