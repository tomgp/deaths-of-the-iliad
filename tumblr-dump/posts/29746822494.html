<blockquote><p>Now powerful Agamemnon caught [Antimachus&#8217;] two sons riding the same chariot, both struggling to curb their high-strung team the reigns slipped their grasp, both horses panicked as Agamemnon ramped up in their faces like a lion&#8212; both fighters shouting from their chariot, pleading,</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>but only heard merciless voice in answer: &#8220;Cunning Antimacus! &#8230; You&#8217;re his sons? Now pay for your father&#8217;s outrage, blood for blood!&#8221;</p> <p>And he piched Pisander off the chariot onto earth and plunged a spear in his chest&#8212;the man crashed on his back as Hippolochus leapt away, but <em>him</em> he killed on the ground, slashing off his arm with a sword, lopping off his head and he sent him rolling through the carnage like a log.</p></blockquote>
