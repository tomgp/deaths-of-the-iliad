<blockquote><p>No Trojans could save him now, strain as they might&#8212; Ajax son of Telamon charging quickly into the carnage speared him at close range through a bronze-cheeked helmet, the horsehair crest cracked wide open around the point, smashed by the massive spear and hand that drove it. His brains burst from the wound in sprays of blood soaking the weapons&#8217; socket&#8212; his strength dissolved on the spot, his grip loose and he dropped the foot of brave Patroclus&#8217; corpse.</p></blockquote>
