<blockquote><p>Menelaus rose with a bronze lance and a prayer to Father Zeus and lunging out at Euphorbus just dropping back, pierced the pit of his throat&#8212;leaning into it hard, his whole arm&#8217;s weight in the stroke to drive it home and the point went slicing through the tender neck. He fell with a crash, armor ringing against his ribs, his locks like the Graces&#8217; locks splashed with blood, still braided tight with gold and silver clip, pinched in like a wasp&#8217;s waist. There he lay like an olive slip a farmer rears to strength on a lonely hilltop, drenching it down with water, a fine young stripling tree, and the winds stir it softly, rustling from every side, and it bursts with silver shoots&#8212; then suddenly out of nowhere a wind in gale force comes storming, rips it out of its trench, stretches it out on the earth&#8212; so Panthous&#8217; stripling son lay sprawled in death, Euphorbus who hurled the strong ashen spear&#8230; Menelaus cut him down</p></blockquote>
