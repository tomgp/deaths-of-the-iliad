<blockquote><p>Athena, eyes blazing, breathed fury into Diomedes and he went whirling into the slaughter now, hacking left and right and hideous groans broke from the dying Thracians slashed by the sword&#8212;the ground ran red with blood. As a lion springs on flocks unguarded, shepherd gone, pouncing on goats or sheep and claw-mad for the kill, so Tydeus&#8217; son went tearing into that Thracian camp until he&#8217;d butchered twelve. Each man he&#8217;d stand above and chop with the sword, the cool tactician Odysseus grappled from behind, grabbing the fighter&#8217;s heels, dragging him out the way with one thought in mind: that team with their flowing manes must get through fast, not quake at heart and balk, trampling over the dead, those purebred horses still not used to corpses. But now the son of Tydeus came upon the king, the thirteenth man, and ripped away his life, his sweet life as he lay there breathing hard. A nightmare hovered above his head that night&#8212; Diomedes himself!</p></blockquote>
