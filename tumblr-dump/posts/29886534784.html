<blockquote><p>Agamenon lunged up, under his bossed shield, thrust home hard with the polished bronze point, unstrung his limbs and reared and lopped his head and the head tumbled onto his fallen brothers corpse. So then and there under royal Agamemnon&#8217;s hands the two sons of Antenor filled out their fates and down they plunged to the strong House of Death.</p></blockquote>
