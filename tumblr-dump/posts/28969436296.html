<blockquote><p>One horse was finished, hit by a shaft that fair-headed Helen&#8217;s lord, magnificent Paris winged at his brow&#8217;s high peak where the forelock crowns the skull&#8212;most fatal spot. It reared in agony, arrow piercing its brain and flung the team in panic, writhing around the brazen point as the horseman hewed the trace-horse clear, hacked away the straps&#8212;sudden strokes of his sword.</p></blockquote>
