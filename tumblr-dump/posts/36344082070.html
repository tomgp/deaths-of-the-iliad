<blockquote><p>Then Tros, Alastor&#8217;s son, crawled to Achilles&#8217; knees and clutched them, hoping he&#8217;d spare him, let Tros off alive, no cutting him dow in blood, he&#8217;d pity Tros, a man of his own age&#8212;the young fool, he&#8217;d no idea, thinking <em>Achilles</em> could be swayed! Here was a man not sweet at heart, not kind,no, he was raging, wild&#8212;as Tros grasped his knees, desperate, begging, Achilles slit open his liver, the liver spurted loose, gushing with dark blood, drenched his lap and the night swirled down his eyes as his life breath slipped away.</p></blockquote>
