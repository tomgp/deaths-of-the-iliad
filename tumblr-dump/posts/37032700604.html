<blockquote><p>Death cut him short. The end closed around him. Flying free of his limbs his soul went winging down to the House of Death, wailing his fate, leving his manhood far behind, his young and supple strength. But brilliant Achilles taunted Hector&#8217;s body, dead as he was, &#8220;Die, die! For my own death, I&#8217;ll meet it freely&#8212;whenever Zeus and the other deathless gods would like to bring it on!&#8221;</p> <p>With that he wenched his bronze spear from the corpse, laid it aside and ripped the bloody armour off the back. And the other sons of Achaea, running up around him, crowded closer, all of them gazing wonder-struck at the build and marvelous lithe beauty of Hector. And not a man came forward who did not stab at his body, glancing toward a comrade, laughing: &#8220;Ah, look here&#8212; how much softer he is to handle now, this Hector, than when he gutted our ships with roaring fire!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
