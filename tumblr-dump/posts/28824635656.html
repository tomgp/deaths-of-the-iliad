<blockquote><p>That monster&#8212; Lycurgus cut him down by stealth, not force at all, on a footpath so cramped his iron club was useless fending off death. There&#8212;before he could heft it&#8212;asudden lunge and Lycurgus&#8217; spear had run him through the guts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Flashback: Lycurgus kills Areithous</p> <p>This killing occurs before the start of the Iliad, and is related by Nestor who always seems to have a story about the old days and how stuff was better back then.</p> <p>Think I might have missed a few flashbacks in the first couple of books I may add them into the archive if I ever revisit those parts of the poem.</p> <p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0140445927/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=iliaddeaths-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0140445927">Homer, The Iliad book 7.
