<p>Phew! Well there you go then, I think that&#8217;s the last one.</p> <p><strong>MASSIVE</strong> thanks to everyone who followed along and <em>liked</em> and <em>reblogged</em>; I hope you enjoyed it. If you haven&#8217;t read the Iliad I really do recommend it, quite apart from the bone crunching, skull splitting, marrow bubbling violence, it&#8217;s full of real beauty and humanity&#8212; it&#8217;s one of those things where everyone says it&#8217;s great and it turns out when you read it finally that actually it really is great. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0140445927/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=iliaddeaths-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0140445927">Fagles&#8217; translation is the one I&#8217;ve been using here and, from my (admittedly very limited) exposure to the alternatives, I think it&#8217;s the one to get .</a></p> <p>Also kudos to <a href="https://twitter.com/kategobell">Kate Bell</a> who set up our Iliad book group and to the other members for making it super amazing.</p> <p>I&#8217;ll still be posting some bits and pieces here over the next few months.

Cassandra appears in the Iliad only briefly, this ABBA song deals with events quite a bit after the end of the poem i.e. the aftermath of Troy&#8217;s sacking.</p>
