<blockquote><p>As the Argive spun in retreat his shield-rim tripped him&#8212; down to his feet that shield he bore to keep off spears&#8212; he stumbled over it now, pitched back, helmet clanging harshly against his brows as the man hit the ground. But Hector marked him at once, rushed up to his side and staked a spear in his chest to kill the fighter right in the eyes of loyal comrades standing by. Sick for their friend but what could <em>they</em> do? Nothing&#8212; just shake with dread in the face of mighty Hector.</p></blockquote>
