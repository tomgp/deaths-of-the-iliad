<blockquote><p>He couldn&#8217;t escape&#8212;no retreat, no dodging the stroke, like a pillar or tree crowned with leaves, rearing, standing there stock-still as the hero Idomeneus stabbed him square in the chest and split the bronze plate that cased his ribs, gear that had always kept destruction off his flesh but it cracked and rang out now, ripped by the spear. Down Alcathous crashed and the point stuck in his heart and the heart in its last throes jerked and shook the lance&#8212; the butt end quivering into the air till sudenly rugged Ares snuffed its fury out, dead still.</p></blockquote>
