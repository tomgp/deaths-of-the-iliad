<blockquote><p>Bright as that star amid stars in the night sky, star of the evening, brightest star that rides the heavens, so fire flared from the sharp point of the spear chilles brandished high in his right hand, bent on Hector&#8217;s death, scanning his splendid body&#8212;where to pierce it best? The rest of his flesh seemed all encased in armour, burnished, brazen&#8212;_Achilles&#8217;_ armour that Hector stripped from strong Patroclus when he killed him&#8212;true, but one spot lay exposed, where collarbones lift the neckbone off the shoulders, the open throat, where the end of life comes quickest&#8212;_there_ as Hector charged in fury brilliant Achilles drove his spear and the point went stabbing clen through the tender neck but the heavy bronze weapon failed to slash the windpipe&#8212; Hector could still gasput some words, some last reply&#8230; he crashed in the dust&#8212; </p> <p> godlike Achilles gloried over him: &#8220;Hector&#8212;surely you thought when you stripped Patroclus&#8217; armour that you, you would be safe! Never a fear of me&#8212; far from the fighting as I was&#8212;you fool! Left behind there, down by the beaked ships his great avenger waited, a greater man by far&#8212; that man was I, and I smashed your strength! And you&#8212; the dogs and birds will maul you, shame your corpse while Achaeans bury my dear friend in glory!&#8221; </p></blockquote>
