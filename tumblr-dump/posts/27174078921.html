<blockquote><p>Just as Diomedes hefted a boulder in his hands, a tremendous feat&#8212; no two men could hoist it, weak as men are now, but all on his own he raised it high with ease, flung it and struck Aeneas&#8217; thigh where the hipbone turns inside the pelvis, the joint they call the cup&#8212; it smashed the socket, snapped both tendons too and the jagged rock tore back the skin in shreds. The great fighter sank to his knees, bracing himself with one strong forearm planted against the earth, and the world went black as night before his eyes.</p></blockquote>
