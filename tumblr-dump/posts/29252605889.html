<blockquote><p>The archer loosed a fresh shaft from the bowstrin straight for Hector, his spirit longing to hit him&#8212; but he missed and cut Gorgythion down instead, a well-bred son of Priam, a handsome prince, and the arrow pierced his chest, Gorgythion whom Priam&#8217;s bride from Aesyme bore one day, lovely Castianira lithe as a deathless goddess&#8230; As a garden poppy, burst into red bloom, bends, drooping its head to one side, weighed down by its full seeds and a sudden spring shower, so Gorgythion&#8217;s head fell limp over one shoulder, weighed down by his helmet.</p></blockquote>
