<blockquote><p>Patroclus never saw him coming, moving across the deadly rout, shrouded in thick mist and on he came against him and looming up behind him now&#8212; slammed his broad shoulders and back with the god&#8217;s flat hand and his eyes spun as Apollo knocked the helmet off his head and under his horses hooves it tumbled, clattering on with it four forged horns and its hollow blank eyes and its plumes were all smeared in the bloody dust</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>And now, right at his back, close-up, a Dardan fighter speared him squarely between the shoulder blades with a sharp lance. Panthous&#8217; son Euphorbus, the best of his own age at spears and a horseman&#8217;s skill and speed of foot, and even in this, his first attack in chariots&#8212; just learning the arts of war&#8212; he&#8217;d brought down twenty drivers of their cars. He was the first to launch a spear against you, Patroclus O my rider, but did not bring you down. Yanking out his ashen shaft from your body, back he dashed and lost himself in the crowds&#8212; the man would not stand up to Patroclus here in mortal combat, stripped, defenseless as he was. Patroclus stunned by the spear and the god&#8217;s crushing blow was weaving back to his own thronging comrades, trying to escape death&#8230;</p> <p>Hector waiting watching the greathearted Patroclus trying to stagger free, seeing him wounded there with the sharp bronze came rushing into him right accross the lines and rammed his spearshaft home, stabbing deep in the bowels, and the brazen point went jutting straight out through Patroclus&#8217; back. Down he crashed&#8212;horror gripped the Achaean armies.</p></blockquote>
