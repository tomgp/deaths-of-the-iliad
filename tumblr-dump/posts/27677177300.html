<blockquote><p>Tlepolemus raised his ashen spear and the same moment shafts flew from their hands and Sarpedon hit him square across the neck, the spear went ramming through&#8212;pure agony&#8212; black night came swirling down across his eyes. But Tlepolemus&#8217; shaft had struck Sarpedon too, the homed tip of the weapon hitting his left thigh, ferocious, razoring into flesh and scraping bone but his Father beat of death a little longer.</p></blockquote>
