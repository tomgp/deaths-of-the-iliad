<blockquote><p>Struggling for breath, Hector, his helmet flashing, said, &#8220;I beg you, beg you by your life, yor parents&#8212; don&#8217;t let the dogs devour me by the Argive ships! Wait, take the princely ransom of bronze and gold, the gifts my father and noble mother will give you&#8212; but give my body to frined to carry home again, so Trojan men and Trojan women can do me honor with fitting rites of fire once I am dead&#8221;</p> <p>Staring grimly, the proud runner Achilles answered, &#8220;Beg no more, you fawning dog&#8212;begging me by my parents! Would to god my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw&#8212; such agonies you have caused me! Ransom? No man alive could keep the dog packs off you, not if they haul in ten, twenty times that ransom and pile it before me and promise fortunes more&#8212; no not even if Dardan Priam should offer to weigh out your bulk in gold! Not even then will your noble mother lay you on your deathbed, mourn the son she bore&#8230; The dogs and birds will rend you&#8212;blood and bone!&#8221;</p> <p>At the point of death, Hector, his helmet flashing, said, &#8220;I know you well&#8212;I see my fate before me. Never a chance that I could win over.. Iron inside your chest, the heart of yours. But now beware, or my curse will draw go&#8217;s wrath upon your head, that day when Paris and lord Apollo&#8212; for all your fighting heart&#8212;destroy you at the Scaean Gates!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
