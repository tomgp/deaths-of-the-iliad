<blockquote><p>Shaking a spear Polydamas moved in fast to the rescue, Pantous&#8217; son lancing the right shoulder of Prothoënor, Arielycus&#8217; son, and the heavy shaft impaled his upper arm&#8212; he pitched in the dust, clawing the earth with both hands and Polydamas shouted over him, wild with glory now: &#8220;Here is another spear which leaps from my strong arm, from Panthous&#8217; brave son, and hits its mark, by god! It&#8217;s found its home in an Argive&#8217;s waiting flesh&#8212; a crutch in his grip, I&#8217;d say, as he trudges down now to the House of Death!</p></blockquote>
