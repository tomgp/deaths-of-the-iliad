<blockquote><p>but hounding him as he went Meriones speared him between the genitals and the naval&#8212;hideous wound, the worst the god of battles deals to wretched men. There the spear stuck. Hugging the shaft he writhed, gasping, shuddering like some wild bull in the hills that herdsmen shackle, trapping the beast with twisted ropes and he fights them all the way as the men drag him off&#8212; so he gasped with his wound. A little, not for long. Till the hero Meriones moved in where he sprawled, wrenched the spear from his corpse and the dark came shrouding down across his eyes.</p></blockquote>
<p>148: Meriones kills Adamas</p> <p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0140445927/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=iliaddeaths-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0140445927">Homer, The Iliad book 13. Translated by Robert Fagles</a></p> <p><em>between the genitals and the naval</em> seems sometimes to be translated as the testicles or scrotum eg <a href="http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/homer/iliad13.htm">Ian Johnson 2008</a>: &#8220;and hit him underneath his navel, in the scrotum, the most agonizing way for men to perish miserably in battle.&#8221;</p> <p>either way, pretty painful I imagine.</p>
