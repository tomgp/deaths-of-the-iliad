<blockquote><p>Patroclus hurled next, the bronze launched from his hand&#8212;no miss, a mortal hit. He struck him right where the midriff packs the pounding heart and down Sarpedon fell as an oak or white poplar falls or towering pine that shipwrights up on a mountain hew down with whetted axes for sturdy ship timber&#8212; so he stretched in front of his team and chariot, sprawled and roaring, clawing the bloody dust. As the bull a marauding lion cuts from the herd, tawny and greathearted among the shambling cattle, dies bellowing under the lion&#8217;s killing jaws&#8212;</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>Death cut him short. The end closed in around him, swirling down his eyes, choking off his breath. Patroclus planted a heel against against his chest, wrenched the spear from his wound and the midriff came out with it&#8212;so he dragged out both the man&#8217;s life breath and the weapon&#8217;s point together.</p></blockquote>
