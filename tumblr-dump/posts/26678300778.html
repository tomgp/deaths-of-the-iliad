<blockquote><p>Meges killed Pedaeus, Antenor&#8217;s son, a bastard boy but lovely Theano nursed him with close, loving care like her own children, just to please her husband. Closing, Meges gave him some close attention too&#8212; the famous spearman struck behind his skull, just at the neck-cord, the razor spear slicing straight up through the jaws, cutting away the tongue&#8212; he sank in the dust, teeth clenching the cold bronze.</p></blockquote>
<p>13: Meges kills Pedaeus</p> <p>Longer excerpt than usual, this is my favourite so far.</p> <p>Most of the deaths have been preceded by some kind of mini biog of the fallen - as my friend Abbie commented &#8220;exemplary war reporting&#8221; - I&#8217;ve mostly been cutting these out but this is a great example. Also the way it switches from tender reflection to the brutal geometry of spear impact is really sweet. <em>Meges gave him some close attention too&#8212;</em></p> <p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0140445927/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=iliaddeaths-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0140445927">Homer, The Iliad book 5.
